R has a number of built-in datasets to work with, one of them is =airquality= which reports daily air quality measurements in New York, from May to September 1973. Variables measured include
- =Ozone=:     Mean ozone in parts per billion (ppb)             
- =Solar.R=:   Solar radiation in Langleys (lang)          
- =Wind=:      Average wind speed in miles per hour (mph)              
- =Temp=:      Maximum daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (degrees F) 
- =Month=:     Month (1-12)            
- =Day=:       Day of month (5-9)   

  The code above loads the =dyplyr= library and then works to select the top 5 days with the highest concentration of Ozone recorded in this period (This was done to reduce the number of rows , src_R{nrow(airquality)}, in the unprocessed dataset). The results are shown below.

Note that these were inserted by calling the above code with the org-mode keyword =#+RESULTS: AirQuality= where AirQuality is the name given to the code block. As for the number of rows described above it was inserted using in-line code =src_R{nrow(airquality)}=.
