**** Exercise 3-8 Seeing the World
Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit.

1. Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order.  Then, print your list in its original order. Don’t worry about printing the list neatly, just print it as a raw Python list ([[l_code:Ch3ex8-1][\rightarrow]]).
2. Use =sorted()= to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list ([[l_code:Ch3ex8-2][\rightarrow]]).
3. Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it  ([[l_code:Ch3ex8-3][\rightarrow]]).
4. Use =sorted()= to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list ([[l_code:Ch3ex8-4][\rightarrow]]).
5. Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again ([[Ch3ex8-3rep][\rightarrow]]). 
6. Use =reverse()= to change the order of your list. Print the list to show that its order has changed ([[l_code:Ch3ex8-6][\rightarrow]]). 
7. Use =reverse()= to change the order of your list again. Print the list to show it’s back to its original order ([[l_code:Ch3ex8-7][\rightarrow]]). 
8. Use =sort()= to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has been changed ([[l_code:Ch3ex8-8][\rightarrow]]). 
9. Use =sort()= to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has changed  ([[l_code:Ch3ex8-9][\rightarrow]]).
