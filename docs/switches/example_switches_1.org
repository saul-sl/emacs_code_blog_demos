* Update repositories and upgrade system in a Debian-based Linux system
To update the list of repositories one usually needs super-user permissions (or use a super-user account). In the former case, one needs to prepend the commands with the =sudo= keyword and (during execution) type the password. Then, to upgrade the packages (if any) one has to type the =upgrade= command using the sudo command again and confirm the instruction. To simplify the process one can run both commands at once and add a confirmation switch after (see line [[(upd-upg)]]).

#+begin_src bash -n -r
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade

  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y				  (ref:upd-upg)
#+end_src
